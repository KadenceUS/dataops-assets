<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#executive-summary" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Kadence’s current data operations environment is fragmented, with approximately 40 codebases that are similar but not identical. This has led to inconsistent logic, lost bug fixes, hard-coded workarounds, and scattered templates, all of which increase maintenance costs and slow development. The lack of object-oriented design, documentation, and standard operating procedures makes improvements and troubleshooting difficult, particularly under tight deadlines and live deployments.</p>
<p>This initiative will modernize our system by consolidating and restructuring the codebase into modular, testable components. Configuration-driven project creation, standardized templates, and improved documentation will reduce duplication, streamline onboarding, and support faster, more reliable project delivery. Ultimately, these changes will free the data team to focus on higher-value analysis while improving the stability and quality of Kadence’s products.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Background on the project, current challenges, and why improvements are necessary.</p>
<h1 id="project-outline">Project Outline<a class="headerlink" href="#project-outline" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The following goals are presented in order of development priority. Each step includes rationale, a rough estimate on development timelines, and realistic expectations.</p>
<h2 id="1-converting-code-to-object-oriented-structure">1. Converting Code to Object-Oriented Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#1-converting-code-to-object-oriented-structure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong><br />
Object-oriented design (OOD) makes code modular, which brings several key advantages. Modular code is easier to reuse across projects, as developers can combine existing components to meet new requirements instead of regularly reinventing the wheel. It is also easier to test and debug, since errors can be isolated within specific objects rather than traced through a long stream of commands. By enforcing clear rules for how data enters and leaves objects, OOD reduces the risk of sweeping code changes when addressing bugs or edge cases.</p>
<p>OOD also improves collaboration and maintainability. With code organized into clear, well-defined components, developers can work on different parts of a system without interfering with one another. This structure also makes it easier for new team members to understand and contribute, reducing the learning curve and lowering the chance of introducing errors. It also means that creating one clear standard operating procedure (SOP) document much simpler.</p>
<p>Finally, OOD makes it easier to scale solutions and adapt to new data sources or methods. A single-purpose script might need to be replaced entirely when requirements change, but a modular OOD framework allows incremental adjustments with minimal disruption. Together, these benefits improve reliability, adaptability, and long-term efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Timeline</strong>
~1 Month</p>
<p><strong>Realistic Expectations</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Requires upfront refactoring, but improves long-term codebase stability.</li>
<li>May reveal existing design flaws that must be addressed before progress.</li>
<li>Involves a learning curve for those new to object-oriented coding.</li>
<li>Development will take time to ensure minimal disruption and maximum usefulness.</li>
<li>Carries a significant upfront cost and QA effort, but will save time over the long run.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2-configuration-driven-project-creation">2. Configuration-Driven Project Creation<a class="headerlink" href="#2-configuration-driven-project-creation" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong><br />
Configuration-driven development is a design approach that enables faster project setup by reusing the same core code, adjusting only those configuration files needed to handle new use cases. Copying and modifying a configuration file is also less error-prone than copying and altering code directly.</p>
<p>This approach reduces the chance of introducing bugs, since most of the underlying code remains untouched. Errors are more often tied to configuration inputs, which are easier to identify and fix, even for non-technical users.</p>
<p>It also helps keep the codebase lean and consistent. Managing one well-tested codebase with multiple configuration files is simpler than juggling multiple nearly identical codebases, which can lead to conflicts, versioning issues, and redundant methods.</p>
<p>Finally, configuration files provide a bridge between developers and domain experts. Because they are easier to read and share, non-technical staff can review and discuss them without needing to understand the underlying code.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Timeline</strong>
~2 weeks</p>
<p><strong>Realistic Expectations</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Reduces manual coding for project setup.  </li>
<li>Some edge cases will still require custom development.  </li>
<li>We plan to consolidate projects into one repository, but this method will mean a lot of project specific sub-folders with multiple files for each project.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="3-creatingupdating-templates-for-raw-data-schema-and-configuration-files">3. Creating/Updating Templates for Raw Data Schema and Configuration Files<a class="headerlink" href="#3-creatingupdating-templates-for-raw-data-schema-and-configuration-files" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong><br />
Using templates with pre-defined schema and endpoint scripts (e.g., Google Apps Scripts, AWS Lambda) provides a faster and more reliable way to launch new projects. Instead of manually recreating schema, dropdowns, and validation rules, teams can start from a ready-made structure, reducing setup time and minimizing overlooked details.</p>
<p>Templates also ensure consistency across projects. Shared frameworks keep formatting uniform, apply validation rules consistently, and use the most up-to-date API scripts. This makes collaboration smoother and reduces confusion when data is shared, since teams see the same structure while still working with their own inputs.</p>
<p>By cutting manual work, templates lower the risk of formatting errors that can disrupt workflows or skew results. With a dependable foundation in place, project teams can focus on adapting templates to specific needs rather than rebuilding basics each time.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Timeline</strong>
~1 week</p>
<p><strong>Realistic Expectations</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Templates will evolve as more use cases appear.  </li>
<li>Full coverage of all input variations may not be possible.  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-automating-the-etl-pipeline-with-hooks-for-live-data-code-updates">4. Automating the ETL Pipeline with Hooks for Live Data &amp; Code Updates<a class="headerlink" href="#4-automating-the-etl-pipeline-with-hooks-for-live-data-code-updates" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong><br />
Automating the ETL pipeline with hooks allows key setup steps to happen automatically whenever important files are created or updated. For example, instead of manually syncing spreadsheets, scripts, or cloud services, the system can run commands in the background to keep everything aligned. Today, this means tools like Google’s clasp can sync Apps Scripts and spreadsheet schema automatically. In the future, the same approach could extend to calling APIs in Mendix, managing AWS processes, or other cloud services. This reduces manual work, lowers the chance of errors, and ensures projects stay consistent as they grow.</p>
<p>We can also ensure that when bugs are found in any core functions, the modifications can be propagated to any other projects that rely on the same code, templates, or supplementary data. This also empowers more members of Kadence to fix issues in any given project. If a simple configuration file value is off, or a minro fix can be done by a project manager, the automatic pipeline will take in the changes and update projects. While this will need to be approached with some degree of caution to avoid unintentional edits, it will still allow PMs to make quick minor changes without forcing the data team to pivot between numerous tasks as often.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Timeline</strong>
~2 weeks</p>
<p><strong>Realistic Expectations</strong><br />
  * Automation will cover the majority of standard workflows.<br />
  * Exceptions may require monitoring or manual fixes.<br />
  * Hooks must be thoroughly tested to avoid silent failures.<br />
  * We will need to carefully consider how to automate updates in the event that a project is sufficiently unique that only core components should be updated automatically.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="5-creating-unit-tests">5. Creating Unit Tests<a class="headerlink" href="#5-creating-unit-tests" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong><br />
Unit testing is the practice of checking small pieces of code in isolation to confirm they work as expected. We can create inputs to a portion of code where we know the expected outputs, and compare the results to validate the codes ability to perform as expected. By testing these building blocks individually, we can catch problems early before they affect larger workflows.</p>
<p>This approach makes debugging faster, since errors can be traced to a specific component instead of searching through an entire project. It also helps ensure that updates or changes to the code don’t accidentally break existing functionality. Ultimately, unit testing provides greater confidence that the system is reliable, reduces rework, and saves time when maintaining or expanding projects. </p>
<p>It also is not an exact process, and can require some time to come up with the best unit tests for cover as many use cases and edges cases as possible. It is often an overlooked part of creating good code, but is a gold standard of good IT products. You can use it to prevent poorly written code from ever going live, but automatically running a unit test and only allowed error free code from being deployed. It is often used in conjunction with a dedicated development compute environment to ensure fault tolerance for the end-user. We do not have a development environment at Kadence, but this would be an important step if we decide to incorporate such a process into our workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Timeline</strong>
~1 Month</p>
<p><strong>Realistic Expectations</strong><br />
  * Full test coverage is unrealistic at the start; focus will be on critical paths.<br />
  * Test suite will expand over time as features stabilize.<br />
  * This will not cover new code quickly. It takes time to develop good unit tests, but it can provide confidence for known processes, and safeguard exisitng projects from small changes causing errors.</p>

<h1 id="persistent-issues">Persistent Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#persistent-issues" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Despite the improvements above, some issues will likely persist due to data quality issues, the organizational structure, and lack of a standard software development life cycle (SDLC).</p>
<h2 id="data-quality-concerns">Data Quality Concerns<a class="headerlink" href="#data-quality-concerns" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Part of what draws clients to Kadence is the flexibility it shows in setting up new projects and in managing their needs. This presents a significant challenges for the data team, however. For small projects, this can be managed by hotfixes and signficiant human oversight, but presents exponentially more difficulties as the number of projects grow or projects scale up in complexity and size.</p>
<p>A few particular reasons why this flexibility creates difficulty on the backend are:</p>
<h3 id="schema-drift-edge-cases">Schema Drift &amp; Edge Cases<a class="headerlink" href="#schema-drift-edge-cases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Input and output data formats may evolve faster than templates can be updated and properly organized.  We aim to move to a configuration driven design, but if each project requires numerous unique templates to function, the likelihood of error increases. We should note that configuration driven approaches are easier to debug, both for a technical and non-technical team member, so we expeect the overall error rates to decrease. The company design choice to allow very flexible products will still pose a challenge going forward as edge cases persist.</p>
<h3 id="human-data-entry-format-drift">Human Data Entry &amp; Format Drift<a class="headerlink" href="#human-data-entry-format-drift" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Manual inputs often lead to inconsistencies, such as typos, missing values, or incorrect formats, which in turn break automated processes that expect standardized data. Unique formatting for specific client requests can cause similar issues, as back-end logic may require a programmatic approach to how data is fed into the pipeline.</p>
<p>Over time, even small variations—like different date formats, naming conventions, or field structures—compound into larger integrity issues that are costly to detect and resolve. These errors increase the likelihood of downstream failures in pipelines, make debugging more difficult, and reduce confidence in analytics. Without strong controls or a more generous development lifecycle, documentation and validation can suffer.</p>
<p>We note that the proposed move to Mendix will help reduce the impact of this category of error, as input is managed through a front-end application that can standardize the process of ingesting data.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-structure">Organizational Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#organizational-structure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The current organizational structure at Kadence for launching projects, providing technical support, and managing ongoing needs differs from more traditional technology companies. While this approach enables speed and flexibility, it also makes it harder to benchmark effectiveness and manage error rates.</p>
<p>Larger data teams often use frameworks like Agile, Kanban, or Scrumban, which provide defined roles and processes to safeguard clients from errors. For example, project managers facilitate communication between technical and domain experts, ensuring feature development aligns with business goals and timelines.</p>
<p>Similarly, dedicated quality assurance professionals focus on identifying flaws and vulnerabilities, allowing developers to concentrate on building functionality. Errors are inherent in coding, and without specialized oversight, even experienced developers can miss issues while managing multiple moving parts.</p>
<p>At Kadence, projects are quickly stood up using code form previous projects and alot of human support in live production environments. This accelerates access to deliverables but bypasses typical IT staging, testing, and validation steps. As a result, the risk of coding errors or misaligned business objectives reaching production is higher, making direct comparisons to traditional IT structures challenging.</p>
<h2 id="software-development-life-cycle">Software Development Life Cycle<a class="headerlink" href="#software-development-life-cycle" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>By skipping a formal Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and exposing data directly to project managers and clients, Kadence increases the risk of errors and inconsistencies. Without structured stages for requirements, design, testing, and validation, issues like coding bugs, misaligned business logic, or incomplete documentation are more likely. While this approach accelerates delivery, it reduces safeguards, making debugging, maintenance, and reliable feature rollout more challenging.</p>
<p>Live rollout also means that requests from project managers or clients may be incorporated without proper design or scoping. This can lead to overly specific code patches that work for a single feature but introduce unintended issues when edge cases arise. It also complicates code reuse across projects, resulting in highly divergent codebases.</p>
<p>Many of these risks can be mitigated through proper scoping and design during an SDLC. In practice, a balance must be struck between SDLC rigor and rapid delivery. The transition to a new, modular codebase presents an opportunity to streamline SDLC processes, enabling faster development while incorporating the necessary safeguards when lead time allows.</p>
